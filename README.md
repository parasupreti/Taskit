# Taskit
Minor project(See Taskit.apk)

OBJECTIVES
Our app aim is to provide the user with the more enriched usage of their Android device and help them to customize the features of their phone as per their daily needs/convenience. Users can customize their phones and use the above mentioned features and many more as per their requirements.
There are several essential, yet often tedious, tasks one often performs throughout the day with their smartphone. Turning on mobile for one app turning it off later, silencing your phone, changing ringer volume from time to time and connecting to Wi-Fi, turning on Bluetooth require sifting through the settings many times a day. Even such simple task often seem burdening when in a rush.
Setting up an automatic trigger makes these and many other tasks simple; you set a “trigger” and a task for it to automatically carry out each time it happens. Everything, without even the click of a finger.

ABRIDGEMENT
The TaskIt Application lets you configure various tasks on your smartphone or tablet. Create your own triggers, make your device automatically change settings like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or perform actions like sending SMS, e-mail, based on the time of day, or any other “event trigger”. The basic idea carried forward is the customization of your android phone using the pre-defined triggers or the customizable triggers and associating a particular type of action.

FEATURES
Simple, yet powerful
Simple Material Design UI, extensive range of tasks that comprise of ‘triggers and actions’. Novices can pick from predefined options, while power users may use expressions and functions. One gets to choose from a set more than 800 such tasks and run several tasks at the same time, even in the background.
Secure
Your task automation “flows” are safe and easy. The application will ask for permissions before accessing your phones settings. And no tasks are of any harm at all to the device. The app’s actions do not require Root Access of any kind.
Share
You can use the in-app forum for all usage questions, feature requests or to report bugs or other issues.
